title: "Announcing Fisheries and Agriculture panel"
author: Conference Chairs
---

Today we are announcing our first panel, focused on Fisheries and Agriculture. 

Food production is essential to a sustainable, prosperous future. NL has a deep history of
fisheries and agriculture, but like all sectors it must find efficiencies and new ways of
practice to decarbonize. Join us as we discuss opportunities within these sectors to
improve nutrition, employment, and sustainable practice while reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. 

The panel will be chaired by Dr. Brett Favaro and Dr. Barb Neis (Memorial University), and the panelists will be Keith Sullivan (Fish, Food, and Allied Workers Union), Carey Bonnell (Ocean Choice International), Mervin Wiseman (Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Agriculture), and Kristie Jameson (FoodFirst NL).

In the coming weeks we will announce each session as speakers and topics are finalized. Delegates attending DNL may attend whichever sessions most interest them, and at the conclusion of the conference we will share lessons learned and produce an action plan, with recommendations that can help us build the sustainable decarbonized economy that NL needs.
