Announcing two panels at Decarbonize NL: [**Urban transportation**](/images/DNL - Urban Transportation.pdf) and [**Off-grid electricity**](/images/DNL - Off-grid electricity.pdf)

*Off-grid electricity*: NL leads Canada in renewable energy development; however, electricity generation differs dramatically in off-grid regions, where communities rely almost exclusively on diesel fuel. We will address off-grid decarbonization challenges, opportunities and cutting-edge research.

*Urban transportation*: The citizens of a typical North American city are often dependent on the gas powered car to move people from point A to B. St. Johnâ€™s and other towns and cities in Newfoundland are no exception. How could other, less carbon-intensive options such as cycling and public transit be enhanced? Can we create a transportation system in Newfoundland with zero carbon emissions within a few decades?

PDFs of the panels are available for [**Urban transportation**](/images/DNL - Urban Transportation.pdf) and [**Off-grid electricity**](/images/DNL - Off-grid electricity.pdf)
