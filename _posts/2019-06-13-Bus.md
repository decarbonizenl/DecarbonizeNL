We are pleased to introduce Metrobus as our transportation partner for Decarbonize NL.

Metrobus has generously offered to provide **free transit passes** to all Decarbonize NL delegates throughout the duration of the conference (July 11 and 12, 2019).

Public transportation is a key plank of any decarbonization strategy and we want to encourage public transit, walking, and cycling to this event. More information about Metrobus and its routes [**can be found here**](https://www.metrobus.com/html-default/system_map.asp).

So, we look forward to seeing you at Decarbonize NL!
