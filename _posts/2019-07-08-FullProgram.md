We are very excited to announce that the [**FULL CONFERENCE PROGRAM**](/images/DNL - Conference Program.pdf) full conference program is now available! Please follow this link to check it out. We will not be providing paper copies of this program, so please refer to your electronic copy.

All panels have now been announced as well. See the full program, or check out the [*program*](/program) page for details. 

In the program you will find a mock-up of the name badge at Decarbonize NL. Show this to your Metrobus driver (either by printing, or on your phone) to get Metrobus access to the confernece, until you get your conference badge. Once you have your actual badge, that can be used as your bus pass on July 11 and 12.
