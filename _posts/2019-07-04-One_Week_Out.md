title: "DNL is One Week Away!"
author: Conference Chairs
---

We are excited to be just over one week away from Decarbonize NL! In advance of the conference, we have a few things we'd like to communicate, and also we 
have a request.

1: If you are only planning on attending a single day of DNL, please let us know ASAP if you haven't done so already. We are determining final numbers for catering and don't want to overbuy or underbuy. 

2: I've enclosed our schedule at-a-glance below. There will be three concurrent sessions, organized by subject. Delegates will pick which panels they want to attend throughout the event, and the plenary and final sessions will bring all delegates and experts together, collectively, into a single space.

3: Reminder to review our [**Participation guide**](/participation/) before the event. Note especially our goal of focusing discussion on how to decarbonize, not whether we should. In addition, have a look at our Code of Conduct - we anticipate this will be a great event, and these policies are in place to help keep the day moving forward! If you have any questions or need an accommodation that we have not anticipated or explicitly listed on the site, please let us know ASAP and we will do our best to make the space welcoming for you.

4: Each session will have two components: an expert-panel, and a delegate-led Citizen's Assembly, where all of you will have the chance to envision a carbon-neutral economy for NL. The panels only will be live-streamed. The Citizen's Assembly component will not be live-streamed, so you don't have to worry about appearing on the Internet if you don't want to! A complete program will be posted early next week.

5: Silo-busting and networking is an explicit goal of the event. We recommend bringing business cards and have built lots of networking space into the program, including a social on the afternoon of July 11.

6: There will be a community space at the back of the room throughout the conference, on which we welcome people to bring pamphlets, brochures, or other materials that delegates may wish to post to promote decarbonization projects, businesses, or services relevant to NL. 

7: We have arranged for Free Metrobus access for all DNL delegates on July 11 and 12. Your conference badge will serve as your bus pass - and we will send a PDF version for you to show the driver so you can get there on the morning of July 11. Parking at SHC is at your own expense.

8: We recommend doing a little studying before the event. See our [**Participation**](/participation/) page for four papers that will prime you about climate change!

Keep an eye on the @DecarbonizeNL twitter account as we announce the remainder of our panels!

PDFs of the panels are available for [**Urban transportation**](/images/DNL - Urban Transportation.pdf) and [**Off-grid electricity**](/images/DNL - Off-grid electricity.pdf)
