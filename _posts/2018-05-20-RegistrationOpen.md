We have two registration rates: Standard, and low-income/travel (offered at a 50% discount). If you are low-income or travelling to St. John's to attend the conference, you are welcome
to select the low-income/travel rate. 

Early-bird, discounted registration is available until **June 10, 2018**, after which all registration fees increase (for both levels). So register soon
to get the lowest price!

Registering for DNL gets you access to the event, where we will be collaboratively designing the economy of the future for Newfoundland and Labrador - including ideas that can be implemented
right away to diversify and decarbonize our economy and build the sustainable future we all deserve. Food will be provided throughout the event.

In the coming weeks, we will make specific announcements about each session that will be held at the event, as well as our groundbreaking plenary speaker who will help us kick off the event.
