ST. JOHN’S, NL - April 18, 2019

Today we are announcing the **Decarbonize NL** conference, which will be held at the Signal Hill Campus of Memorial University on July 11 and 12, 2019. 

The main objective of **Decarbonize NL** is to envision ways to transform Newfoundland and Labrador’s economy and society so that we no longer have to depend on carbon-intensive development for our prosperity. We will identify pathways for aligning NL’s future development with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s warning that humanity must reduce energy derived from oil by 37% by 2030. 

At DNL, expert panels will address decarbonization across all sectors of Newfoundland and Labrador’s economy, including, but not limited to: electricity production, food and fisheries and transportation. We will set out pathways for achieving industry leadership, just transitions, improved building/urban planning and design, and strong and appropriate climate adaptation and policy. 

Attendees will participate in facilitated discussions on these subjects. At the end of the conference we will share lessons learned. A policy report will be produced and freely shared that will summarize the findings from the event.

Registration for DNL will open in May via the website: [decarbonizeNL.ca](http://decarbonizeNL.ca). Early registration will be offered at a discount. Information, including a list of the organizing committee, can be found on the event website.

Conference chairs:
Brett Favaro, Ph.D
Delia Warren, M.BA
Nick Mercer, Ph.D Candidate, MA, BA
