On July 11, 2019, our day will begin with a keynote lecture delivered by [**Catherine Abreu, Executive Director of Executive Director of Climate Action Network – Réseau action climat (CAN-Rac) Canada**](/images/DNL - Plenary Speaker.pdf).

Following the plenary talk, we will have concurrent sessions broken down by sector of the economy (specific subjects to be announced). Each session will have a panel with experts from the field. Following panel talks, the entire group, including delegates, will 
brainstorm ideas for decarbonization in that sector. All members of the audience will be given the opportunity and means to participate in the discussion.

On July 12, 2019, we will start the day with more sessions. 

The day will end with an optional fieldtrip to a local renewable energy project.

# Session list

Each session will be listed below, and we will add to this list as panelists are finalized:

- [**Fisheries and agriculture**](/images/DNL - Fisheries and Agriculture.pdf)

- [**Off-grid electricity**](/images/DNL - Off-grid electricity.pdf)

- [**Just Transitions**](/images/DNL - Just transitions.pdf)
- [**Climate Adaptation and Policy**](/images/DNL - Adaptation and Policy.pdf)

# Deliverables from each session

We are hoping to emerge from DNL with each of the following from each session:

1.	Three actions that would promote decarbonization within the respective sector
2.	Policy recommendations that would support each action
3.	The likely consequences (costs and benefits) if the above action is taken

# Outputs from the event

Following the conclusion of DNL, we will produce a guidebook that synthesizes the policy ideas generated at the event. This book will be made available to all levels of government and the general public.

## Post-conference fieldtrip

After conclusion of the conference, on the afternoon of July 12th, there will be an optional field trip to the Fermeuse Wind Farm. Travel will be by bus from Signal Hill Campus. The tour of the wind farm will be guided by local expert followed by a meal and workshop at a local restaurant (at attendees expense) before heading back to Signal Hill.
