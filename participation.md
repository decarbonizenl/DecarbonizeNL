This event will be held at the [Signal Hill Campus](https://www.mun.ca/signalhill/) of Memorial University of Newfoundland. 

## How to decarbonize - not whether

Climate change and decarbonization are topics that inspire passionate debate. In order to keep the space productive and to accomplish the goals of the event, we ask that all participants be prepared to discuss **how best to decarbonize** NL's economy - NOT to debate **whether we should do so.** 

By attending and participating in this conference, we ask that you, for the purposes of discussion, accept the science that climate change is real, dangerous, and caused by human activities (primarily the combustion of fossil fuels). If you do not hold these views, you are still welcome - provided you agree to nevertheless focus your contributions on **how**, not **whether** to reshape NL's economy to fight climate change.

We further ask that all delegates come to DNL with the mindset that NL has the same obligation as the rest of the world to decarbonize. We feel the space will be unproductive if we spend the time debating whether NL has a role in decarbonization.

## Code of Conduct

We are employing a [code of conduct](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2016.00103/full) for this event. 

DNL's mission is to envision an economy in NL that is in compliance with the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needed to fight climate change. This topic will arouse debate, and strong disagreements may occur. We see this as an asset – it is our explicit mission to set up a space so that these discussions can happen. However, there is a line between debate and disrespect – and if that line is crossed, the space is no longer productive. We also value providing a safe, equable, inspiring space for delegates from around the world.  Our respectful dialogue policy asks that participants make every effort to maintain constructive discourse with other conference attendees at all times.

The Decarbonize NL Code of Conduct outlines the following expected behaviours from all delegates: 

* Treat everyone with respect and consideration.
* Communicate openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that are different than your own.
* Be respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

The following behaviours are unacceptable: 
* Harassment and intimidation, including any verbal, written, or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate, or coerce another delegate, conference organizers, or staff.
* Discrimination based on gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin, or culture.
* Physical or verbal abuse of any attendee, speaker, volunteer, exhibitor, staff member, service provider or other meeting guest.
* Disrespectful disruption of presentations.

Note that the above unacceptable behaviours are guidelines, rather than strict definitions. 

### Consequences

Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. 

DNL staff (or their designee) or security may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including immediate removal from the meeting without warning and potentially without refund.

### Reporting Unacceptable Behaviour
