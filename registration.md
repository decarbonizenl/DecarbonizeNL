### Want to help make DNL more accessible?

We graciously accept sponsorship, with benefits outlined in the prospectus: http://decarbonizenl.ca/sponsors/ 

All sponsorship revenue is used directly to fund the event and any post-event expenses associate with communicating the outcomes of Decarbonize NL. Our primary goal is to make this an affordable, inclusive event to attend.
