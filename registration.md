## Participation

Before registering, please review our [*Participation*](/participation/) page for event rules, including the Code of Conduct. Decarbonize NL is a space to discuss **how** to decarbonize, not **whether** to do so.

Registration fees pay for facility rental, catering during the event, and other organizing expenses. We are operating on a strictly break-even basis for the event. Fee schedule is as follows:

## Early bird, from now until June 16, 2019

Standard: $70. Low-income/travelling: $35.

## Regular, from June 17, 2019 until start of event

Standard: $100. Low-income/travelling: $50.

The low-income/travelling rate is intended to support people attending DNL from across the province. In addition, anyone who self-identifies as low-income can avail of our reduced-cost rate, no questions asked.

## Wind Farm Field trip

There is an [*optional post-conference field trip*](/images/Wind farm field trip.pdf) to a wind farm in Fermeuse. The registration fee ($25) can be paid at the time of registration and covers the cost of transportation and a bag lunch. The field trip will include a stop at a local restaurant (registration fee does not cover food during the fieldtrip).

## Web-based attendance

The program committee is working on organizing satellite sessions at key points across the province. Stand by for further announcements.

### Want to help make DNL more accessible?

We graciously accept sponsorship, with benefits outlined in the prospectus: http://decarbonizenl.ca/sponsors/ 

All sponsorship revenue is used directly to fund the event and any post-event expenses associate with communicating the outcomes of Decarbonize NL. Our primary goal is to make this an affordable, inclusive event to attend.
