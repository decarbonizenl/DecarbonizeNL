Standard: $100. Low-income/travelling: $50.

The low-income/travelling rate is intended to support people attending DNL from across the province. In addition, anyone who self-identifies as low-income can avail of our reduced-cost rate, no questions asked.

## Web-based attendance

The program committee is working on organizing satellite sessions at key points across the province. Stand by for further announcements.

### Want to help make DNL more accessible?

We graciously accept sponsorship: http://decarbonizenl.ca/sponsors/ 

If we can secure sufficient sponsorship, we will reduce registration costs. Our primary goal is to make this an affordable, inclusive event to attend.
